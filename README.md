I am a third year Computer Science co-op student at the University of Waterloo! I enjoy programming, developing, and learning new skills. The only things hindering me are the fact that there is only 24 hours in a day, and the mountains of calculus homework I still need to complete.
I hope that one day I will be able to live in a world free of calculus exams, but alas, that day has still not come.
